Database performance geeks,

We have a number of patches pending for 8.4 designed to improve database 
performance in a variety of circumstances.  We need as many users as possible 
to build test versions of PostgreSQL with these patches, and test how well 
they perform, and report back in some detail.

Particularly, users with unusual hardware architectures (16 or more cores, 
ARM, Power, SSD, NFS-mounted data) or operating systems (Solaris, OSX, 
Windows-64) are really helpful.  Testers need to be familiar with building 
PostgreSQL from source and patching it, as well as basic PostgreSQL Tuning 
(except for the Wizard Patch) and have some kind of performance test 
available, ideally something based on your own application use.

If you are going to use pgbench to test, *please* read Greg Smith's notes 
first: 
http://www.westnet.com/~gsmith/gregsmith/content/postgresql/pgbench-scaling.htm

The Wiki (http://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/CommitFest_2008-11) has a full list 
of patches, but below are the ones in particular we could use help with.

You *do* need to read the entire mail threads which I link to below to 
understand the patches.  Thanks for your help!

Also, the following patches currently still have bugs, but when the bugs are 
fixed I'll be looking for performance testers, so please either watch the 
wiki or watch this space:

-- Block-level CRC checks (Alvaro Herrera)
-- Auto Partitioning Patch (Nikhil Sontakke)
-- posix_fadvise (Gregory Stark)
-- Hash Join-Filter Pruning using Bloom Filters
-- On-disk bitmap indexes

Please report your results, with the patchname in the subject line, on this 
mailing list or on -hackers.  Thank you, and your help will get a better 8.4 
out sooner.
