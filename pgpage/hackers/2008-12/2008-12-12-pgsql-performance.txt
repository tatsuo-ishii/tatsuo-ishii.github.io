Do you have any profile data to back that up?  I think it's more likely 
that bottlenecks are on the tuple processing side of things as you also 
suggested.  There's really no sense guessing; one quick session with 
something like oprofile would be more informative than any amount of 
speculation on what's going on.

Have you ever looked into how much memory ends up showing up as 
"Writeback" in /proc/meminfo when this happens?  The biggest problem with 
that kernel out of the box on the kind of workload you're describing is 
that it will try and buffer way too much on the write side by default, 
which can easily get you into the sort of ugly situations you describe. 
I regularly adjust that kernel to lower dirty_ratio in particular 
dramatically from the default of 40 to keep that from happening.  I did a 
whole blog entry on one of those if you're not familiar with this 
particular bit of painful defaults already:

The largest database I manage is running on a Sun X4500, which is right at 
that price point.  I've never seen it not be CPU bound.  Even though 
people are pulling data that's spread across a few TB of disk, the only 
time I ever see it straining to keep up with something there's always a 
single CPU pegged.
