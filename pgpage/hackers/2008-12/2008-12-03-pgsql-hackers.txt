Committed.

I haven't done any doc changes for this yet. I think a short section in 
the "database internal storage" chapter is probably in order, and the 
fact that plain VACUUM skips pages should be mentioned somewhere. I'll 
skim through references to vacuum and see what needs to be changed.

Hmm. It just occurred to me that I think this circumvented the 
anti-wraparound vacuuming: a normal vacuum doesn't advance relfrozenxid 
anymore. We'll need to disable the skipping when autovacuum is triggered 
to prevent wraparound. VACUUM FREEZE does that already, but it's 
unnecessarily aggressive in freezing.
