Hi

I had a look at the sources, especially the ServerLoop routine and
the socket initializations.
And in my point of view it's ok.
I did some test and ran into more problems using the hpux select()
together with sockets. Although the listening socket is in
blocking mode, waiting for an incoming request, the select() call ---
with struct timeval set to NULL --- returns immediatly. This is
*definitly* --- IMO --- a bug and does not follow the man pages
submitted by HP. 
Until now I was not able to connect to the listening socket of
the postmaster (HPUX 10.20). I tried a lot of things, but -:(

Maybe they will never be a stable running postgreSQL on a
HP-UX 10.? system until HP fix their socket/select features and 
probably some of their damned system headers.

For every HP-UX release I run into more problems in compiling my own
sources.I pray for 10.30 will never come out... and beware of 11...

Ciao
Alex
