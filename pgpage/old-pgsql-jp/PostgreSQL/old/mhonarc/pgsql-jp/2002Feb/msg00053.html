  $$$"TRUE STORY" SEEN ON ABC's 20-20 "BOY MAKES 71 THOUSAND IN 5
WKS!!! YOU CAN TO!!"

  AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV: THIS IS THE ONE!

  Parents of 15-year-old find $71,000 cash hidden in his closet.

  Does this headline look familiar? Of course it does.  You most
likely have just seen this story recently featured on a major nightly
news program
(USA).

  His mother was cleaning and putting laundry away when she came
across a large brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried beneath
some clothes
and a skateboard in the back of her 15-year-old sons closet. Nothing
could have prepared her for the shock she got when she opened the bag
and found it was full of cash. Five-dollar bills, twenties, fifties
and hundreds - all neatly rubber-banded in labeled piles.

  "My first thought was that he had robbed a bank", says the
41-year-old woman, "There was over $71,000 dollars in that bag --
that's more than my husband earns in a year".

  The woman immediately called her husband at the car-dealership
where he worked to tell him what she had discovered. He came home
right away and
they drove together to the boys school and picked him up. Little did
they suspect that where the money came from was more shocking than
actually finding it in the closet.

  As it turns out, the boy had been sending out, via E-mail, a type
of "Report" to E-mail addresses that he obtained off of the
Internet.
Everyday after school for the past 2 months, he had been doing this
right on his computer in his bedroom.
 
  "I just got the E-mail one day and I figured what the heck, I put
my name on it like the instructions said and I started sending it
out", says the clever 15-year-old.
 
  The E-mail letter listed 5 addresses and contained instructions to
send one $5 dollar bill to each person on the list, then delete the
address at the top and move the others addresses down , and finally
to add your name to the top of the list.

  The letter goes on to state that you would receive several thousand
dollars in five-dollar bills within 2 weeks if you sent out the
letter
with your name at the top of the 5-address list. "I get junk E-mail
all the time, and really did not think it was going to work", the
boy continues.
 
  Within the first few days of sending out the E-mail, the Post
Office Box that his parents had gotten him for his video-game
magazine subscriptions began to fill up with not magazines, but
envelopes containing $5 bills. "About a week later I rode [my bike]
down to the post office and my box had 1 magazine and about 300
envelops stuffed in it. There was also a yellow slip that said I had
to go up to the [post office] counter.  I thought I was in trouble or
something (laughs)". He goes on, "I went up to the counter and they
had a whole box of more mail for me.  I had to ride back home and
empty out my backpack because I could not carry it all".
 
  Over the next few weeks, the boy continued sending out the
E-mail."  The money just kept coming in and I just kept sorting it
and stashing it in the closet, barely had time for my homework". He
had also been riding his bike to several of the banks in his area and
exchanging the $5 bills for twenties, fifties and hundreds.  "I
didn't want the banks to get
suspicious so I kept riding to different banks with like five
thousand at a time in my backpack. I would usually tell the lady at
the bank counter that my dad had sent me in [to exchange the money]
and he was outside waiting for me. One time the lady gave me a really
strange look and told me that she would not be able to do it for me
and my dad would have to come in and do it, but I just rode to the
next bank down the street (laughs)."
 
  Surprisingly, the boy did not have any reason to be afraid. The
reporting news team examined and investigated the so-called
"chain-letter" the boy was sending out and found that it was not a
chain-letter at all. In fact, it was completely legal according to US
Postal and Lottery Laws, Title 18, Section 1302 and 1341, or Title
18, Section 3005 in the US code, also in the code of federal
regulations, Volume 16, Sections 255 and 436, which state a product
or service must be exchanged for money received.
 
  Every five-dollar bill that he received contained a little note
that read, "Please send me report number XYX".  This simple note
made the letter legal because he was exchanging a service (A Report
on how-to) for a five-dollar fee.

  Here is the letter that the 15-year-old was sending out by E-mail,
you can do the exact same thing he was doing, simply by following the
instructions in this letter.
 
  Dear Friends &amp; Future Millionaires:

  AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV:
 
  Making over half million dollars every 4 to 5 months from your home
for an investment of only $25 U.S. Dollars expense one time.  THANKS

COMPUTER AGE AND THE INTERNET !
 
 =======================================================
 
  BE A MILLIONAIRE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR!!!
 
  Before you say ''Bull'', please read the following. This is the
letter you have been hearing about on the news lately. Due to the
popularity of this letter on the Internet, a national weekly news
program recently devoted an
entire show to the investigation of this program described below, to
see if it really can make people money. The show also investigated
whether or not the program was legal.
 
  Their findings proved once and for all that there are "absolutely
NO Laws prohibiting the participation in the program" and if people
can follow the simple instructions, they are bound to make some mega
bucks with only $25 out of pocket cost. DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF
POPULARITY &amp; RESPECT THIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED,IT IS CURRENTLY
WORKING BETTER THAN EVER.
 
  This is what one had to say: "Thanks to this profitable
opportunity. I was approached many times before but each time I
passed on it. I am so glad I finally joined just to see what one
could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required. To
my astonishment, I received total $610,470.00 in 21 weeks, with money
still coming in."  Pam Headland, Fort Lee, New Jersey.
 
  =======================================================
 
  Here is another testimonial: "This program has been around for a
long time but I never believed in it. But one day when I received
this again in the mail I decided to gamble my $25 on it. I followed
the simple instructions and wale ..... 3 weeks later the money
started to come in. First month I only made $240.00 but the next 2
months after that I made a total of $290,000.00. So far, in the past
8 months by re-entering the program, I
have made over $710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The key to
success in this program is to follow the simple steps and NOT change
anything."

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

  FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTIONS BELOW AND YOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS WILL
COME TRUE, GUARANTEED!

  INSTRUCTIONS:

  Order all 5 reports shown on the list below For each report, send
$5 CASH, THE NAME &amp; NUMBER OF THE REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR
E-MAIL ADDRESS to the person whose name appears ON THAT LIST next to
the report.

  MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE TOP LEFT CORNER
in case of any mail problems.

  When you place your order, make sure you order each of the 5
reports. You will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on
your computer and resell them. YOUR TOTAL COST $5 X 5=$25.00. Within
a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each of the 5 reports from
these 5 different individuals. Save them on your computer so they
will be accessible for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will
order them from you.  Also make a floppy of these reports and keep it
on your desk in case something happens to your computer.  IMPORTANT -
DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed next to each
report, or their sequence on the list, in any way other than what is
instructed below in step '' 1 through 6 '' or you will loose out
on the majority of your profits. Once you understand the way this
works, you will also see how it does not work if you change it.
Remember, this method has been tested, and if you alter, it will NOT
work !!! People have tried to put their friends/relatives names on
all five thinking they could get all the money.

  But it does not work this way. Believe us, we all have tried to be
greedy and then nothing happened. So Do Not try to change anything
other than what is instructed. Because if you do, it will not work
for you.

  Remember, honesty reaps the reward!!!

  1.... After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this advertisement
and REMOVE the name &amp; address of the person in REPORT # 5.

  This person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting
their fortune.

  2.... Move the name &amp; address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT # 5.

  3.... Move the name &amp; address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT # 4.

  4.... Move the name &amp; address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT # 3.

  5.... Move the name &amp; address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT # 2

  6.... Insert YOUR name &amp; address in the REPORT # 1 Position.

  PLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name &amp; address ACCURATELY!

=======================================================


  Take this entire letter, with the modified list of names, and save
it on your computer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES. Save this on a
disk as well just in case you loose any data.  To assist you with
marketing your business on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase
will provide you with
invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk
e-mails legally, where to find thousands of free classified ads and
much more.


  There are 2 Primary methods to get this venture going:

  METHOD #1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY
   
        =======================================================

  Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes,
and we will assume You and those involved send out only 5,000 e-mails
each. Let's also assume that the mailing receive only a 0.2%
response (the response could be much better but lets just say it is
only 0.2%. Also many people will send out hundreds of thousands
e-mails instead of only 5,000 each).

  Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails. With
a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for report # 1. Those 10
people responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail each for a total of
50,000. Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders.
That's=100 people responded and ordered Report # 2. Those 100 people
mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000 e-mails.  The 0.2%
response to that is 1000 orders for Report # 3. Those 1000 people
send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 5 million e-mails sent
out. The 0.2% response to that is 10,000 orders for Report # 4. 
Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of
50,000,000(50 million) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100,000
orders for Report # 5 THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5
EACH=$500,000.00 half million).

  Your total income in this example is:
  1..... $50 +
  2..... $500 +
  3..... $5,000 +
  4..... $50,000 +
  5..... $500,000
  Grand Total=$555,550.00

  NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL &amp; PAPER AND FIGURE OUT THE WORST
POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL
MAKE A LOT OF MONEY !

=======================================================

  REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE ORDERING OUT OF
5,000 YOU MAILED TO.

  Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or
even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000 e-mails each or more?
There are over 150 million people on the Internet worldwide and
counting. Believe me, many people will do just that, and more!

  METHOD # 2 : BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET

=======================================================

  Advertising on the net is very inexpensive and there are hundreds
of FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the
Internet will easily get a larger response. We strongly suggest you
start with Method # 1 and METHOD # 2 as you go along.  For every $5
you receive, all you must do is e-mail them the Report they ordered.
That's it. Always provide same day service on all orders.

  This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out, with your name
and address on it, will be prompt because they can not advertise
until they receive the report.

  AVAILABLE REPORTS
  ==============================================
  ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER &amp; NAME ONLY.  Notes: Always send $5
cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for each Report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure
the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper.
On one of those sheets of paper, Write the NUMBER &amp; the NAME of the
Report you are
ordering, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and your name and postal address.

  YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES
 
  Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success: If you do not
receive at least 10 orders for Report #1 within 2 weeks, continue
sending e-mails until you do.  After you have received 10 orders, 2
to 3 weeks after that you should receive 100 orders or more for
REPORT # 2. If you did not, continue advertising or sending e-mails
until you do. Once you have received 100 or more orders for Report #
2, YOU CAN RELAX, because the system is already working for you, and
the cash will continue to roll in!

  THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER:

  Every time your name is moved down on the list, you are placed in
front of a Different report. You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by
watching which report people are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO
GENERATE MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF E-MAILS AND START THE
WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN.

  FOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM:

  You have just received information that can give you financial
freedom for the rest of your life, with NO RISK and JUST A LITTLE BIT
OF EFFORT. You can make more money in the next few weeks and months
than you have ever imagined. Follow the program EXACTLY AS
INSTRUCTED. Do Not change it in any way. It works exceedingly well as
it is now. Remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report after
you have put your name and address in Report #1 and moved others to
#2 ...........# 5 as instructed above. One of the
people you send this to may send out 100,000 or more e-mails and your
name will be on every one of them. Remember though, the more you send
out the more potential customers you will reach. So my friend, I have
given you the ideas, information, materials and opportunity to become
financially independent.



  IT IS UP TO YOU NOW !

  MORE TESTIMONIALS:

  "My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in Chicago. I am an
accountant with a major U.S.  Corporation and I make pretty good
money. When I received this program I grumbled to Jody about
receiving ''junk mail''. I made fun of the whole thing, spouting
my knowledge of the population and percentages involved. I
''knew'' it wouldn't work. Jody totally ignored my supposed
intelligence and few days later she jumped in with both feet. I made
merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old ''I told you
so'' on her when the thing didn't work. Well, the laugh was on me!
Within 3 weeks she had received 50 responses. Within the next 45 days
she had received total $ 147,200.00 ........... all cash! I was
shocked. I have joined Jody in her ''hobby''.  Mitchell Wolf
M.D., Chicago, Illinois

=======================================================

  ''Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make
up my mind to participate in this plan.  But conservative that I am,
I decided that the initial investment was so little that there was
just no way that I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my
money back''. '' I was surprised when I found my medium size post
office box crammed with orders. I made $319,210.00
in the first 12 weeks. The nice thing about this deal is that it does
not matter where people live. There simply isn't a better investment
with a faster return and so big."  Dan Sandstorm, Alberta, Canada

=======================================================

   ''I had received this program before. I deleted it, but later I
wondered if I should have given it a try.  Of course, I had no idea
who to contact to get another copy, so I had to wait until                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                de
$20,560.00 and by the end of third month my total cash count was
$362,840.00. Life is beautiful, Thanks to internet.".  Fred Delia,
Westport, New Zealand
