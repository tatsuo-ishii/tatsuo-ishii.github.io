早速、御回答いただきありがとうございました。

&gt; gcc や flex のバージョンはいくつですか？また、とりあえず 
&gt; backend が落ちたときの back trace と Makefile.global を見せて頂けませ
&gt; んか？

＊バージョン
gcc  : 2.7.2.2
flex : 2.5.4

＊backend が落ちた後のメッセージ

mydb=&gt; mydb=&gt; select * from book;
FATAL:  unrecognized data from the backend.  It probably dumped core.
FATAL:  unrecognized data from the backend.  It probably dumped core.
mydb=&gt; \d
PQexec() -- Request was sent to backend, but backend closed the channel before r
esponding.  This probably means the backend terminated abnormally before or whil
e processing the request.
mydb=&gt; 

＊Makefile.global
postgreとパッチの両者の内容は以下のとおりです。
(そのまま貼り付けましたので、長くなります）

# NOTES
#    Essentially all Postgres make files include this file and use the 
#    variables it sets.  
#
#    To override the default setting, create a Makefile.custom in this
#    directory and put your defines there. (Makefile.custom is included
#    near the end of this file).  Sometimes, a variable gets set in
#    Makefile.global after Makefile.custom has been included, so you can't
#    simply set that variable in Makefile.custom.  In those cases, there is
#    often another variable (like CUSTOM_COPT) that you can set in 
#    Makefile.custom that influences the later setting of the true variable
#    of interest (like CFLAGS) by Makefile.global.
#
#
#    If you change any of these defines you probably have to 
#       make clean; make
#    since no dependencies are created for these. (of course you can 
#    be crafty and check what files really depend on them and just remake
#    those).
#        
#    Before including this file, you must set the SRCDIR variable to the 
#    path of the top of the Postgres source tree (the directory that 
#    contains this file).
