内田です。

990308 の Postmaster が落ちる件の続報です。postmaster の debuglog の停
止直前の部分もちょっと長いですが添付します。

990217 はまったく落ちないので、990308 に戻して試してみたところ、前とは
違う状況で(postmaster の zombie が大量に残る)状況で止まってしまいます。

いちおうマシンリソースとの兼ね合いから、バックエンドの最大接続数は 32 
に変更してあります。また、Postmaster の起動は以下の手順です。

  #!/bin/bash
  ulimit -n 20
  su - postgres -c 'exec postmaster -d 1 -i -o -F &gt;&gt; /usr/local/pgsql/postmaster.log 2&gt;&amp;1'
  

ただ、ulimit -n 20 を指定しているにも関わらず、httpd の error_log に以
下のようなメッセージが出ているので、ファイルテーブルを使い果たしている
ようです。httpd の MaxClient が 100 なのが多すぎるのかなぁ。
