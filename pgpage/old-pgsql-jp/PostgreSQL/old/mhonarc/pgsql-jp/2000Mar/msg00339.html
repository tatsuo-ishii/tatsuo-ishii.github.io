&gt; 
&gt; Just a quick announcement that we've put beta3 up for download today ...
&gt; 
&gt; Since there has been very little bug reports between beta2 and beta3, this
&gt; one is considered to be the first Candidate for Release.  Altho its still
&gt; beta, there should be negligible risk of a subsequence "beta requiring an
&gt; initdb" happening ...
&gt; 
&gt; The actual tar ball and web page changes were made at ~midnight, so that
&gt; the mirror sites had a chance to get sync'd up before the announcement,
&gt; with changes from beta2 as follows.
&gt; 
&gt; Any bugs or problems with this beta should be reported to 
&gt; pgsql-bugs@postgresql.org using the bug report template that is included
&gt; with the distribution ...
&gt; 
&gt; Marc G. Fournier                   ICQ#7615664               IRC Nick: Scrappy
&gt; Systems Administrator @ hub.org 
&gt; primary: scrappy@hub.org           secondary: scrappy@{freebsd|postgresql}.org 
&gt; 
&gt; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt; 
&gt; - Since PORTNAME is no longer used at the level of C code (it's only in
&gt;   Makefiles now), there's no reason for os2client to maintain its own
&gt;   copy of c.h just to change #define PORTNAME.  Simplify Makefile
&gt;   accordingly.  Get rid of horribly-out-of-date modified copy of c.h,
&gt;   which should never have been in the distribution to start with, since
&gt;   it's actually a derived file.  Now it's not needed anyway.
&gt; 
&gt; - Add exp(), ln(), and some other functions to numeric-functions table.
&gt; 
&gt; - Fold PQsetenv working state into PGconn, rather than trying to maintain
&gt;   it in a separate object.  There's no value in keeping the state
&gt;   separate, and it creates dangling-pointer problems.  Also, remove
&gt;   PQsetenv routines from public API, until and unless they are redesigned
&gt;   to have a safer interface.  Since they were never part of the documented
&gt;   API before 7.0, it's unlikely that anyone is calling them.
&gt; 
&gt; - Add note that ':' and ';' operators are deprecated.
&gt; 
&gt; - Modify lexing of multi-char operators per pghackers discussion around
&gt;   16-Mar-00: trailing + or - is not part of the operator unless the
&gt;   operator also contains characters not present in SQL92-defined
&gt;   operators.  This solves the 'X=-Y' problem without unduly constraining
&gt;   users' choice of operator names --- in particular, no existing Postgres
&gt;   operator names become invalid.
&gt; 
&gt; - Also, remove processing of // comments, as agreed in the same thread.
&gt; 
&gt; - empty define that results in an empty but terminated line ( ; ) easy
&gt;   (maybe dumb) fix for 5 in attachment define.patch greetings, Andreas
&gt; 
&gt; - Back out // compiler flag.
&gt; 
&gt; - absolute pathnames for the copy 
&gt; 
&gt; - This patch corrects spelling, grammar and euphony for the psql reference
&gt;   page for 7.0: Oliver Elphick
&gt; 
&gt; - Add safety check on expression nesting depth.  Default value is set by a
&gt;   config.h #define, and the runtime value can be controlled via SET.
&gt; 
&gt; - Change configure.in to note that since we are using expr(1)'s regex
&gt;   match command, the entries in template/.similar can really be regular
&gt;   expressions.  This isn't a new feature, just an observation of what the
&gt;   code already did.
&gt; 
&gt; - Turn XLOG off (do not create log file).
&gt; 
&gt; - ExecSubPlan needs to be able to cope with RelabelType nodes atop the
&gt;   Const placeholder nodes for subplan result values.
&gt; 
&gt; - Correct typo in error message.
&gt; 
&gt; - Several calls to StrNCpy incorrectly subtracted 1 from the length arg,
&gt;   leading to postmaster accepting args 1 shorter than it had room for.
&gt; 
&gt; - Repair logic flaw in cost estimator: cost_nestloop() was estimating CPU
&gt;   costs using the inner path's parent-&gt;rows count as the number of tuples
&gt;   processed per inner scan iteration.  
&gt; 
&gt; - Restructure planning code so that preprocessing of targetlist and quals
&gt;   to simplify constant expressions and expand SubLink nodes into SubPlans
&gt;   is done in a separate routine subquery_planner() that calls
&gt;   union_planner().
&gt; 
&gt; - A little further tweaking of the range-query selectivity logic: to avoid
&gt;   undue sensitivity to roundoff error, believe that a zero or slightly
&gt;   negative range estimate should represent a small positive selectivity,
&gt;   rather than falling back on a generic default estimate.
&gt; 
&gt; - If we cannot get a real estimate for the selectivity of a range query,
&gt;   use a default value that's fairly small.  We were generating a result of
&gt;   about 0.1, but I think 0.01 is probably better --- want to encourage use
&gt;   of an indexscan in this situation.
&gt; 
&gt; - Minor code rearrangement &amp; doc improvement in eval_const_expressions().
&gt; 
&gt; - Add syntax for BIT() and BIT VARYING(), but no underlying implementation
&gt;   is available yet.
&gt; 
&gt; - Remove redundant call to xlateSqlType() in the character type handling
&gt;   code.
&gt; 
&gt; - Emit 'this operator is deprecated' warnings for ':' and ';'.
&gt; 
&gt; - Add FORCE keyword to ColID
&gt; 
&gt; - Just noticed that the grammar actually has no provision for '+' as a
&gt;   prefix operator :-(.  Bad enough that we have no implementation of unary
&gt;   plus, but at least with this fix the grammar will take it.
&gt; 
&gt; - Add translation of timespan to interval.
&gt; 
&gt; - Remove no-longer-necessary restriction against uplevel correlation vars
&gt;   outside WHERE clause.  Fix a couple of places that didn't handle uplevel
&gt;   refs cleanly.
&gt; 
&gt; - Hack parse_coerce so it won't try to constant-fold the dummy Const nodes
&gt;   introduced by make_subplan().  It'd be better if we used a different
&gt;   node type for subplan result placeholders, but for now...
&gt; 
&gt; - Reverse out BYTEA type coersion.
&gt; 
&gt; - Add compatiblity information for bytea.
&gt; 
&gt; - In can_coerce_type, verify that a possible type-coercion function
&gt;   actually returns the type it is named for.
&gt; 
&gt; - transformExpr() did the Wrong Thing if applied to a SubLink node that
&gt;   had already been transformed.  This led to failure in examples like
&gt;   UPDATE table SET fld = (SELECT ...).  Repair this, and revise the
&gt;   comments to explain that transformExpr has to be robust against this
&gt;   condition. 
&gt; 
&gt; - Another go-round with resolution of ambiguous functions and operators.
&gt;   In function parsing, try for an actual function of the given name and
&gt;   input types before trying to interpret the function call as a type
&gt;   coercion request, rather than after.  Before, a function that had the
&gt;   same name as a type and operated on a binary-compatible type wouldn't
&gt;   get invoked.  Also, cross-pollinate between func_select_candidates and
&gt;   oper_select_candidates to ensure that they use as nearly the same
&gt;   resolution rules as possible.  A few other minor code cleanups too.
&gt; 
&gt; - Improve error message wording in unary_op_error() --- suggest that
&gt;   problem could be lack of parentheses.  This addresses cases like X
&gt;   UserOp UserOp Y, which will be parsed as (X UserOp) UserOp Y, whereas
&gt;   what likely was wanted was X UserOp (UserOp Y).
&gt; 
&gt; - cash_words_out function truncated its output by 1 character due to
&gt;   incorrect use of StrNCpy.
&gt; 
&gt; - Float-to-int conversion functions should return NULL when given NULL
&gt;   input, not throw a gratuitous elog().
&gt; 
&gt; - Clean up minor compiler warnings.
&gt; 
&gt; - Improve selectivity estimation involving string constants: pay attention
&gt;   to more than one character, and try to do the right thing in non-ASCII
&gt;   locales.
&gt; 
&gt; - Update for BYTEAOID.
&gt; 
&gt; - Rename bytea functions to not have upper-case letters in their names.
&gt;   Clean up grotty coding in them, too.  AFAICS from the CVS logs, these
&gt;   have been broken since Postgres95, so I'm not going to insist on an
&gt;   initdb to fix them now...
&gt; 
&gt; - Update pg_dumpall again.
&gt; 
&gt; - Fix pg_dumpall for new psql output.
&gt; 
&gt; - it seems in the beta2 release DBUSERID in pg_dumpall is the _name_ of
&gt;   the user, so it doesn't need to be translated from the number to the
&gt;   name. also ``create database ...'' does not take numbers for the
&gt;   encoding, so the ENCODING variable does not need to be translated to a
&gt;   number, but left as the text representation.  a patch is supplied to
&gt;   make the changes i have found to work.  i was successful dumping and
&gt;   reloading my database after these changes. - John M. Flinchbaugh
&gt; 
&gt; - Fixed psql -c "\slashcmd"
&gt; 
&gt; - Change MemSet and StrNCpy to evaluate their arguments only once. 
&gt; 
&gt; - Fix inadequate parenthesization in several other macros.
&gt; 
&gt; - Fix incorrect implementation of log(x) for numeric, as well as incorrect
&gt;   descriptions of a couple of log-related functions. I will not force an
&gt;   initdb for this, but log() on a numeric won't work until you do one...
&gt; 
&gt; - Update bytea type description
&gt; 
&gt; - Patch possible portability problem: a few places had // style comments,
&gt;   which is not ANSI C, even though some compilers will take it...
&gt; 
&gt; - Repair typos: &lt;xb&gt; EOF rule should be &lt;xh&gt;, likewise &lt;xq&gt; to &lt;xd&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; - compiler finds wrong include file extern.h in ecpg/lib/descriptor.c from
&gt;   include path instead of workdir (rename it ?)
&gt; 
&gt; - fe-connect getsockopt takes a socklen_t as fifth arg not int (use
&gt;   SOCKET_SIZE_TYPE instead)
&gt; 
&gt; - char vs unsigned char in psql calls to libpq
&gt; 
&gt; - empty define that results in an empty but terminated line ( ; )
&gt; 
&gt; - This would allow to write applications which do not have a link to
&gt;   postgres_ext.h in their source directory. Andreas Kardos
&gt; 
&gt; - Forgot that odbc had its own copies of config.sub/config.guess. Update
&gt;   those to latest Autoconf sources, too.
&gt; 
&gt; - Fix query for primary keys to reflect new DISTINCT ON () syntax.
&gt; 
&gt; - Make use of pre-existing regexp match capability to eliminate redundant
&gt;   entries in template selection rules.  
&gt; 
&gt; - change alpha-dec-osf pattern to cope with version info attached to the
&gt;   'alpha' part.
&gt; 
&gt; - Convert float8 regress test to use exp() and ln() instead of ':' and ';'
&gt;   operators.
&gt; 
&gt; - Update test for new ORDER BY clause from Tom Lane.
&gt; 
&gt; - subselect regress test was kind of silly; it claimed to test correlation
&gt;   cases but actually did no such thing.  Make it test some more cases than
&gt;   before (including things that didn't work in 6.5).
&gt; 
&gt; - Typo correction (// -&gt; /)
&gt;
