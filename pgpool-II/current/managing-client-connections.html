>   As the number of client connections accepted is growing, the
   number of <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>Pgpool-II</SPAN
> child process
   which can accept new connections from client is decreasing and
   finally reaches to 0. In this situation new clients need to wait
   until a child process becomes free. Under heavy load, it could
   be possible that the queue length of waiting clients is getting
   longer and longer and finally hits the system's limit (you might
   see "535 times the listen queue of a socket overflowed"
   error"). In this case you need to increase the queue
   limit. There are several ways to deal with this problem.

><P
>    The obvious way to deal with the problem is increasing the
    number of child process. This can be done by
    tweaking <A
HREF="runtime-config-connection.html#GUC-NUM-INIT-CHILDREN"
>num_init_children</A
>. However
     increasing child process requires more CPU and memory
     resource. Also you have to be very careful about
     max_connections parameter
     of <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> because once the
     number of child process is greater than
     max_connections, <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> refuses
     to accept new connections, and failover will be triggered.
   </P
><P
>    Another drawback of increasing num_init_children is, so called
    "thundering herd problem".  When new connection request comes
    in, the kernel wake up any sleeping child process to issue
    accept() system call. This triggers fight of process to get
    the socket and could give heavy load to the system. To
    mitigate the problem, you could set serialize_accept to on so
    that there's only one process to grab the accepting socket.

>    Another solution would be increasing the connection request
    queue. This could be done by
    increasing <A
HREF="runtime-config-connection-pooling.html#GUC-LISTEN-BACKLOG-MULTIPLIER"
>listen_backlog_multiplier</A

>    However, none of above solutions guarantees that the
    connection accepting the queue would not be filled up. If a
    client connection request arrives quicker than the rate of
    processing queries, the queue will be filled in someday. For
    example, if there are some heavy queries that take long time,
    it could easily trigger the problem.
   </P
><P
>    The solution is
    setting <A
HREF="runtime-config-connection.html#GUC-RESERVED-CONNECTIONS"
>reserved_connections</A
> so that
     overflowed connection requests are rejected
     as <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> already does. This
     gives visible errors to applications ("Sorry max_connections
     already") and force them retrying. So the solution should only
     be used when you cannot foresee the upper limit of system
     load.
